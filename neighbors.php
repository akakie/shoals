<p>Unless otherwise noted, most community bands welcome guests to sit in. Exceptions might occur in
final rehearsals before a concert. Usually, if you're in the area, and have your instrument, you
will be welcome to play. As one director said, "If you don't have your instrument, well, there is always
the percussion section. They can always use someone who can count and hit things at the right time
and in the right place." <em>[Ed. note: Don't shoot the messenger.]</em></p>
